# Anthony-Groce-Portfolio
## Introduction:

This is my portfolio initially started to satisfy our 2nd Challenge in the Northwestern Coding Bootcamp.  I will be adding to this portfolio as I progress through the bootcamp.

## Getting Started:

This portfolio can be viewed in any browser or any device that can view a webpage.  It should be flexible enough to be viewed on mobile devices, but I have my doubts currently.  I will continue to ensure this is accessible on all screens.

## Features:

### Header - 
    The header contains a background image, a portrait of myself, my name as the title, and 3 buttons that link to locations in the webpage - About Me, Portfolio, and Contact.

### The Body - 
    In the body, I attempted to use flex to organize my boxes.  I was challenged thoroughly by the example provided which showed a "side-bar" next to the main content.  I'm happy that I somewhat achieve this, however, I have made a mess of my parent-child flex relationships and have yet to fix that.  

### The Footer -
    The footer is a basic, single color bar with contact information.  These will be clickable links when finished.

### The Background -
    The background is a gradient from a light-aqua at the top, fading into a navy-dark-gray on the bottom.
